DMA full space analogue hardware

This firmware implements base-space ratio coverage, device emulation, and extensive feature obfuscation.

It has been tested on many platforms such as VGK FACEIT!

The purpose of the open source is that one of my customers leaked it and made it widely available! It was even resold several times! That's why I made the firmware public, and the anti-cheat system will be able to characterise the firmware's space when it's made public! So after a while he will probably not be able to use it again!
