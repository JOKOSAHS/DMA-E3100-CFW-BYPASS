## DMA Full Space Analogue Hardware

This firmware offers base-space ratio coverage, device emulation, and extensive feature obfuscation. It has been successfully tested on platforms such as VGK FACEIT.

**Purpose of Open Source**: Following a leak by a customer, the firmware became widely distributed and resold. To address this, it has been made public. Note that once exposed, anti-cheat systems will likely detect the firmware's space, which may limit its future usability.

**Devices for Full Emulation**: Killer series network cards.

**New Update**: We have modified a new IP core to support the detection of Delta games.

## Exposing Kilmu and His Scams

I want to bring attention to a serious issue involving a person named Kilmu, who has been exploiting open-source models to defraud agents and users, particularly targeting individuals in the Chinese community. 

Kilmu has threatened me, demanding that I help him convince others that his agent wasn't lying. In reality, his agent has cheated many people out of their money.

It's crucial to understand that there are numerous scammers in this space, preying on unsuspecting users. These individuals thrive on deception, using open-source programs to mislead and exploit others.

I am committed to exposing these scams and protecting those who might be vulnerable to such tactics. If you have any information or experiences related to Kilmu and similar scams, please share them. Together, we can help prevent further exploitation.

Stay vigilant and be cautious!
