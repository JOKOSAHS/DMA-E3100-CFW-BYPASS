## DMA Full Space Analogue Hardware

This firmware offers base-space ratio coverage, device emulation, and extensive feature obfuscation. 

It has been successfully tested on platforms such as VGK FACEIT.

**Purpose of Open Source**: Following a leak by a customer, the firmware became widely distributed and resold. To address this, it has been made public. 

Note that once exposed, anti-cheat systems will likely detect the firmware's space, which may limit its future usability.

We are not working with any developers and any mention of us is false!

## Exposing Kilmu and His Scams

I want to bring attention to a serious issue involving a person named Kilmu, who has been exploiting open-source models to defraud agents and users, particularly targeting individuals in the Chinese community.

Kilmu has threatened me, demanding that I help him convince others that his agent wasn't lying. In reality, his agent has cheated many people out of their money.

It's crucial to understand that there are numerous scammers in this space, preying on unsuspecting users. These individuals thrive on deception, using open-source programs to mislead and exploit others.

I am committed to exposing these scams and protecting those who might be vulnerable to such tactics. If you have any information or experiences related to Kilmu and similar scams, please share them. Together, we can help prevent further exploitation.

Stay vigilant and be cautious!


### Open Access to Network Card DMA Firmware
ACE has recently restricted many RTL-type devices, including network card DMA firmware. Importantly, this technology has become **publicly accessible**, allowing anyone with basic technical knowledge to quickly learn and create it. As a result, prices for these firmware solutions remain relatively affordable, generally within the **100-180 USD** range. This applies to both Killer cards and other models, so prices should not vary significantly.


### Recognizing False Claims and High-Price Tactics
Some individuals may attempt to mislead new players by claiming that open-source network card devices, often with additional modifications, are exclusive "internal" products. They may also assert that their versions are unique or private. 

- **Unique Firmware:** ACE is likely to soon gather data on all such devices. Each firmware version requires unique encoding, ensuring distinct versions for each user.
- **Open and Accessible Technology:** With the right emulation skills, anyone can achieve stability and reliability in these devices. 
There is no "private" firmware—only **thousands of lines of code** accessible to those who seek it.

### Scam Alert
If you’ve paid **300 USD** for network card emulation firmware, there’s a strong chance you’ve been overcharged, as this technology is now widely accessible.


**Devices for Full Emulation**: Killer series network cards.
