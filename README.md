## DMA Full Space Analogue Hardware

This firmware offers base-space ratio coverage, device emulation, and extensive feature obfuscation. It has been successfully tested on platforms such as VGK FACEIT.

**Purpose of Open Source**: Following a leak by a customer, the firmware became widely distributed and resold. To address this, it has been made public. Note that once exposed, anti-cheat systems will likely detect the firmware's space, which may limit its future usability.

**Devices for Full Emulation**: Killer series network cards.
